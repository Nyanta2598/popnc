# About Us

Welcome to **PoPNC** â€” your companion for mastering English grammar in a fun and engaging way.  
We created this platform to offer clear, organized, and accessible grammar resources for learners of all levels.

## Who We Are

We are students from **Pamantasan ng Cabuyao**, aiming to make grammar education more engaging, accessible, and relatable for learners of all ages. By fusing academic language principles with the humor and relevance of memes and pop culture, we strive to turn complex grammar rules into content thatâ€™s both educational and entertaining. Our goal is to foster a fun and modern approach to language learning that resonates with todayâ€™s generation of digital natives.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make grammar:

- **Accessible** to all learners
- **Enjoyable** through creativity and humor
- **Memorable** by using modern references like memes and trending media

We aim to support students, educators, and lifelong learners with resources that are effective, relevant, and fun.
