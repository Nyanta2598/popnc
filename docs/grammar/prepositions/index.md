# 🧭 Prepositions

Prepositions are *words that connect nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words in a sentence, showing relationships like time, place, location, or direction*. They often appear directly before the noun or pronoun they modify, indicating how the words are related within the sentence.

## 🤔 Where exactly is it?

According to the Meriam-Webster Dictionary, a “preposition is “a function word that typically combines with a noun phrase to form a phrase which usually expresses a modification or predication”. 

In this meme, knowledge of preposition empowers a person to be aware of what is the correct usage of the preposition to be used in a situation.

The image humorously depicts the word “here” walking toward the letter “t,” with “here” asking, “Are we there yet?” and “t” responding, “Almost.” The joke plays on the connection between “here” and “there,” visually illustrating how the letter “t” transforms “here” into “there.” This connects to prepositions because prepositions often define location or direction—such as “to,” “from,” or “between.” The image cleverly represents movement toward a destination, reinforcing how prepositions indicate spatial relationships in language.

The comic cleverly uses a bar setting to create a pun about prepositions. Two individuals are seated at the counter, with one listing various prepositions like "outside," "under," "to," "around," and "over." The second person humorously misinterprets this as an attempt to "preposition" them—playing on the similarity between "preposition" (a grammatical term) and "proposition" (often a suggestion or offer, sometimes with romantic connotations).

The bar setting enhances the joke, as it's a common place for social interactions, where propositions might actually occur, making the wordplay feel more natural and amusing.

## 😕 I﻿t's still confusing

The image portrays an elderly woman sitting at a table with a laptop, holding her head in apparent confusion or frustration. The text on the image states:

"ME WHEN I FINALLY LEARN TO USE THE PREPOSITIONS AT, IN, ON, TO, OF."

The joke highlights the complexity of prepositions in English. Even after learning their basic usage, people—including the grandma in the image—can still feel overwhelmed by the nuances of when to use each correctly. 

Prepositions often depend on context, making them tricky to master. For example, choosing between "in the morning" and "on Monday" or understanding why we say "good at something" but "interested in something." This lingering confusion makes the grandma’s reaction relatable, as many language learners experience similar struggles despite their best efforts to understand the rules.

[](https://boggletondrive.com/2011/08/20/ending-sentences-with-prepositions/)The cartoon humorously illustrates a prescriptive grammar rule about avoiding sentence-ending prepositions. One character, holding a book titled Chomsky Now Extra Douchey!, sternly reminds another not to end sentences with a preposition. The second character, annoyed by the correction, responds with a sentence that indeed ends with a preposition: "Will you just piss off?"—ironically proving the point in a natural and defiant way.

Ending a sentence with a preposition has been traditionally discouraged in formal writing because prepositions are meant to link objects within a sentence. However, strict avoidance can make sentences sound awkward or overly rigid. 

> **💡** For example, "From where did you come?" sounds less natural than "Where did you come from?" In modern English, using prepositions at the end is widely accepted when it improves clarity or flow.

The comic exaggerates this grammatical correction, making fun of overly pedantic grammar enforcement while showing that natural speech often defies rigid rules.
