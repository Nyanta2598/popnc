# 🔄 Active vs Passive Voice

Understanding the difference between **active** and **passive** voice helps improve clarity and focus in writing.

---

## ✅ What is Voice?

**Voice** refers to the relationship between the **subject** and the **verb** in a sentence.

- In **active voice**, the subject **does** the action.
- In **passive voice**, the subject **receives** the action.

---

## 🔹 Active Voice

> The subject performs the action.

**Structure**:  
**Subject + Verb + Object**

**Example**:

> 🔹 _The chef **cooked** the meal._  
> (The chef is doing the action)

✅ **Clear**, **direct**, and **strong**.

---

## 🔸 Passive Voice

> The subject receives the action.

**Structure**:  
**Object + be (in correct tense) + past participle + (by + agent)**

**Example**:

> 🔹 _The meal **was cooked** by the chef._  
> (Focus is on "the meal", not who cooked it)

✅ Used when the **doer is unknown**, unimportant, or obvious.

## 🤔 When to Use Passive Voice?

✅ When the **doer** is unknown:

> 🔹 _The window **was broken** last night._

✅ When the **action is more important** than the actor:

> 🔹 _The vaccine **was developed** in record time._

✅ For **formal or scientific writing**:

> 🔹 _The experiment **was conducted** in three phases._

---

## ❌ When to Avoid Passive Voice?

❌ When it makes the sentence wordy, vague, or confusing.

**Unclear**:

> 🔹 _The report was completed._  
> (**By whom? When?**)

✅ Better in active voice:

> 🔹 _The team **completed** the report._

---

## 🧪 Practice: Identify the Voice

> 🔹 _The cake was eaten by the children._ → **Passive**  
> 🔹 _The children ate the cake._ → **Active**

---

## 🔁 Quick Rewrite Practice

Convert to active voice:

1. The letter **was delivered** by the postman.  
   → ✅ _The postman delivered the letter._

2. The book **was read** by Sarah.  
   → ✅ _Sarah read the book._

---

> 💡 **Tip**: Use active voice for strong, clear writing. Use passive voice when needed—but use it **intentionally**.
