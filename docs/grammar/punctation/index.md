# Punctuation

Punctuation marks help clarify meaning in writing. Below is a guide to common punctuation marks and how to use them correctly.

## 1. Period (.)

The period is used to mark the end of a declarative sentence.

Use a period at the end of indirect questions, abbreviations, and initials.

**Examples:**

## 2. Comma (,)

- With non-essential information: My brother, who lives in Canada, is visiting.
