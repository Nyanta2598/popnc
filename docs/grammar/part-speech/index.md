# 🧠 Parts of Speech

English grammar is built on eight basic building blocks known as **parts of speech**. Each part plays a specific role in a sentence. Here's a breakdown:

## 1. 🧍 Noun

A **noun** names a person, place, thing, or idea.

**Examples**:  
`dog`, `city`, `happiness`, `James`

> 🔹 _The cat_ slept on the couch.

## 2. 🔤 Pronoun

A **pronoun** replaces a noun to avoid repetition.

**Examples**:  
`he`, `she`, `it`, `they`, `who`

> 🔹 _Sarah_ is kind. **She** helps everyone.

## 3. ✅ Verb

A **verb** shows action or a state of being.

**Examples**:  
`run`, `is`, `have`, `think`

> 🔹 Birds **fly** in the sky.

## 4. ✏️ Adjective

An **adjective** describes or modifies a noun or pronoun.

**Examples**:  
`happy`, `blue`, `fast`, `tall`

> 🔹 He wore a **red** shirt.

## 5. 🌀 Adverb

An **adverb** modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. It often ends in _-ly_.

**Examples**:  
`quickly`, `very`, `well`, `always`

## 6. 🔗 Conjunction

A **conjunction** connects words, phrases, or clauses.

**Examples**:  
`and`, `but`, `or`, `because`, `although`

## 7. 🧭 Preposition

A **preposition** shows a relationship between a noun (or pronoun) and another word in the sentence.

**Examples**:  
`in`, `on`, `at`, `between`, `over`

> 🔹 The keys are **on** the table.
