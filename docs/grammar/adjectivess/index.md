# **✏️** Adjectives

An adjective is a *word that modifies, describes, or gives more information* about a noun or a pronoun. It helps answer questions like:

* *What kind?*
* *Which one?*
* *How many?*
* *How much?*
* *Whose?*

By using adjectives, we add **detail, emotion, and precision** to our language.

The image features Homer Simpson raising his arms in triumph, with text stating, "WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO WRITE ADJECTIVE IN THE CORRECT ORDER." The reaction symbolizes pride because mastering the correct sequence of adjectives—such as "a beautiful old red house" instead of "a red old beautiful house"—is a nuanced grammatical skill.
