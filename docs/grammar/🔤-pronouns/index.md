There is a wide misconception that the usage of “they/them” is strictly used for groups of people. However, the term has been used as a singular pronoun in English for centuries—especially when the gender of a person is unknown (e.g., "Someone left their umbrella. I hope they come back for it."). This usage is not only grammatically correct but also widely accepted by modern style guides, including the APA and the Chicago Manual of Style.

> The comic satirizes how some objections are rooted more in resistance to social change than in linguistic accuracy.

The comic strip humorously highlights the grammatical difference between "who" and "whom" using a classic knock-knock joke format.

The humor comes from the fact that many people mix up "who" and "whom." "Whom" is correct in this case because it follows "to," a preposition.

The photo connects to pronouns through its focus on inclusion and diversity, as highlighted by the "Queer Tap Dance Revolution" featured in the news segment. Pronouns often play a pivotal role in fostering inclusivity, especially in contexts involving gender and identity. 

For example, the movement showcased in the photo may advocate for using gender-inclusive pronouns like they/them or other personal preferences as part of respecting individual identities. This connection aligns with broader social efforts to create spaces where everyone feels seen and acknowledged, whether in artistic performances, daily language use, or cultural representation.

Traditionally considered plural, “they” is increasingly accepted as a gender-neutral singular option, promoting inclusivity by avoiding assumptions about someone’s gender. While some may still adhere to traditional grammar rules, the meme playfully suggests that using “they” singularly is a conscious choice to be more inclusive and respectful of individuals who don’t identify within the traditional binary gender system. This reflects a shift in language reflecting societal changes in understanding and acceptance of gender identity.
