There is a wide misconception that the usage of “they/them” is strictly used for groups of people. However, the term has been used as a singular pronoun in English for centuries—especially when the gender of a person is unknown (e.g., "Someone left their umbrella. I hope they come back for it."). This usage is not only grammatically correct but also widely accepted by modern style guides, including the APA and the Chicago Manual of Style.
