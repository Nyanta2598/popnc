A statement with double meaning, this meme card both alludes to the grammatical tenses of verb (past, present, and future) and an interpretation pertaining to a person’s romantic partners (past romantic partner, present romantic partner, and future romantic part) and the “tense” atmospheric tension between them in the scenario.

The correct grammatical answer would be present tense, because "I am" is present. But the student replies “past tense”, implying that the teacher was beautiful in the past — not anymore. It's a cheeky kind of insult wrapped in a grammar joke.

The image is a funny take on verb tenses. It shows characters representing past tense (-ed) and present participle (-ing) in a tense situation—like they're about to have a showdown. The joke comes from the word tense, which has two meanings:

1. Grammar meaning: "Tense" refers to verb forms like past, present, and future.
2. Emotional meaning: "Tense" can mean stressful or intense, like in a conflict.

One of the "-ing" characters warns that the "-ed" group has "taken action in the past", which also references their unruly behavior in the past. Hence why there is a tense situation. The humor works by treating verb endings like characters in a dramatic standoff.

The comic humorously plays on the phrase "The Present Tense," using a gift box as a visual pun. The gift—literally "the present"—appears anxious, saying, "All I want is to be accepted, but I'm afraid to open up." This creates a clever double meaning:

* Literal meaning: The present (gift) is "tense" because it feels nervous about being opened.
* Grammatical meaning: The phrase "The Present Tense" refers to the verb tense used for actions happening now.

The joke works by merging these two meanings—turning a grammar term into a relatable emotional experience, where "tense" applies both to feelings of anxiety and verb conjugation.

Just like the chicken above, it is going to be confusing if one was uncertain or is not knowledgeable about what tense of verb must be used in a given situation.

Verb tenses show the time of an action or state of being. They change to indicate:

* When the action happened:  Past, present, or future.
* The duration of the action: Was it a completed action, an ongoing action, or an action completed before another action?

The image depicts two individuals having a conversation. One person asks, "What is the future tense of the sentence 'I had killed a thief'?" The other responds with, "You will go to jail."

The joke stems from the misunderstanding between grammar and real-world consequences. The person asking the question intends to discuss proper verb conjugation. 

Grammatically, the future tense of "I had killed a thief" would be "I will have killed a thief." However, the other person interprets the sentence literally, assuming it describes an actual crime. Their response humorously implies that committing such an act would lead to imprisonment rather than a lesson in verb tenses. The humor lies in the unexpected and practical response to what was meant to be a purely linguistic question.
