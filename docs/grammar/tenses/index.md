A statement with double meaning, this meme card both alludes to the grammatical tenses of verb (past, present, and future) and an interpretation pertaining to a person’s romantic partners (past romantic partner, present romantic partner, and future romantic part) and the “tense” atmospheric tension between them in the scenario.

The correct grammatical answer would be present tense, because "I am" is present. But the student replies “past tense”, implying that the teacher was beautiful in the past — not anymore. It's a cheeky kind of insult wrapped in a grammar joke.

The image is a funny take on verb tenses. It shows characters representing past tense (-ed) and present participle (-ing) in a tense situation—like they're about to have a showdown. The joke comes from the word tense, which has two meanings:

1. Grammar meaning: "Tense" refers to verb forms like past, present, and future.
2. Emotional meaning: "Tense" can mean stressful or intense, like in a conflict.

One of the "-ing" characters warns that the "-ed" group has "taken action in the past", which also references their unruly behavior in the past. Hence why there is a tense situation. The humor works by treating verb endings like characters in a dramatic standoff.
