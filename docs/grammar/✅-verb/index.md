# **✅** Verb

A verb is a word that expresses an action, a state of being, or an occurrence within a sentence. It's essentially the "doing word" that indicates what the subject of the sentence is doing, feeling, or experiencing. 

> 💡 **Tip:** Every sentence requires a verb to be complete.

The image humorously plays with the verb "shakes" in relation to William Shakespeare. By visually depicting "William" and a "Pear," then showing Shakespeare shaking the pear, it creates a clever pun based on his name—turning it into a literal action and making the joke both linguistic and visual.

The image humorously compares different types of headaches to the frustration of learning irregular verbs. While migraine, hypertension, and stress cause physical discomfort, irregular verbs are portrayed as a mental strain. This is because they don’t follow standard grammatical rules, requiring memorization rather than predictable patterns, making them a source of headaches.

The burning house represents the chaos and unpredictability of irregular verbs, which don’t follow standard conjugation patterns (e.g., “go,” “went,” “gone”).  In contrast, the girl’s smug expression implies the relative ease and predictability of regular verbs, which follow consistent patterns (e.g., “walk,” “walked,” “walked”).  The meme uses visual humor to highlight the frustration often associated with learning irregular verbs while emphasizing the straightforward nature of regular verbs.

The comic humorously portrays a pirate obsessed with correcting grammar, specifically replacing "be" with "are." The joke builds as the pirate corrects his crew, eventually yelling "ARRRRRRE!!!" at a departing ship. The exaggerated use of "arr" merges pirate speech with grammar correction, turning it into a playful linguistic gag. Pirates stereotypically say "arr," so the joke cleverly blends their famous exclamation with proper verb usage in a grammatically ironic way.

The image humorously illustrates the difficulty of explaining verb usage. It shows a person in a suit with a blurred face, raising their hands as if mid-explanation, with the text "VERB USAGE IS..." at the top. The joke comes from the fact that their face is distorted, making it look like they're speechless or struggling to articulate their thoughts. This visual exaggeration plays on the idea that verb usage can be overwhelming or hard to explain clearly, leaving even confident speakers momentarily lost for words.

The image seems to depict a scenario involving a boy and a trash can, "The boy will throw the apple in the trash can“ provides a clear example of verb usage within future tense. The verb "will throw" indicates an action that has not yet occurred, but is expected to happen in the future. Here, "will" is the auxiliary (or helping) verb, and "throw" is the main verb, together forming the future tense. The sentence also illustrates, how verbs work with subjects (the boy) and objects (the apple), showing the relationship between the action (throwing) and its target (the apple being thrown). It's a straightforward, yet effective, way to teach how verbs convey timing and action in English.

The meme humorously depicts a scenario where someone asks what a verb is. Another person thinks, then gives a simplistic answer: "A verb is a word." The response is deemed inadequate, and as a result, they are thrown out of a window. The humor comes from the exaggerated reaction to an overly simple definition.
