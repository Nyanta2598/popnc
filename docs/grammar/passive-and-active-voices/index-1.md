# Passive and Active Voices

*In active voice, the subject performs the action, while in passive voice, the subject receives the action*.¬†Active voice is generally clearer and more concise.¬†Passive voice is useful when the action is more important than the doer, or when the doer is unknown or unimportant.¬†

## üëç Passive-aggressive?

The image is a comic strip titled "grammatical voice" by John Atkinson from Wrong Hands. It humorously illustrates three different grammatical voices‚Äîactive, passive, and passive-aggressive‚Äîusing the same idea but altering the sentence structure.

1. Active voice: "No one liked my post." ‚Üí This sentence is direct, clearly stating that the subject (no one) performed the action (liked) on the object (my post).
2. Passive voice: "My post was not liked by anyone." ‚Üí Here, the focus shifts to the object (my post), making the sentence less direct and emphasizing the action rather than the doer.
3. Passive-aggressive voice (a joke addition): "Never mind." ‚Üí This isn‚Äôt a real grammatical voice, but it humorously represents how passive-aggressive statements avoid direct confrontation while still expressing frustration or disappointment.

The joke works by showing how the same sentiment‚Äîfeeling ignored online‚Äîcan be expressed differently depending on grammatical voice.¬†

## üé® Mix-up

The image is a cartoon by Mark Anderson featuring a teacher and a student standing in front of a chalkboard. The board displays two sentences:

1. "The sentence was written in the active voice by the boy."
2. "The boy wrote in the passive voice."

The joke comes from the contradiction in these sentences. The first sentence claims to be active voice but is actually passive, while the second sentence claims to be passive voice but is actually active. This intentional mix-up creates a humorous situation where the teacher, frustrated, asks, "You're just messing with me, aren't you?"

The image is a cartoon by Doug Savage from the Savage Chickens series. It depicts a chicken sitting at a desk, looking at a computer screen with a surprised expression. The text reads:

"AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED. I'M SAYING THIS IN THE PASSIVE VOICE TO AVOID TAKING ANY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY."

The joke highlights how passive voice can be used to deflect blame. Instead of saying "I made an error," which directly assigns responsibility, the sentence "An error has occurred" removes the subject, making it unclear who caused the mistake. This is a common tactic in bureaucratic or corporate language, where passive voice is often used to soften accountability.

Active and passive voice describe how a sentence structures the relationship between the subject and the verb. In active voice, the subject performs the action (e.g., ‚ÄúThe chef prepared the meal‚Äù).¬† The focus is on the actor. Passive voice reverses this, making the subject the receiver of the action (e.g., ‚ÄúThe meal was prepared by the chef‚Äù).¬† The focus shifts to the action itself or the thing acted upon.

While active voice is generally preferred for clarity and directness, passive voice is sometimes used when the actor is unknown, unimportant, or when a more formal or objective tone is desired.¬†The choice depends on what aspect of the sentence you want to highlight.¬†

The image is a meme created by Meme Makers that explains the difference between active and passive voice in English grammar. It uses two panels to illustrate the structure of sentences in both voices.

* In the top panel, labeled "Active voice," the structure is shown as "Subject Verb Object." The person in the image is pointing to the left, middle, and right to indicate the positions of the subject, verb, and object respectively.
* In the bottom panel, labeled "Passive voice," the structure is shown as "Object Verb Subject." The person in the image is pointing to the left, middle, and right to indicate the positions of the object, verb, and subject respectively.
