A period ( . ) is *a punctuation mark that signals the end of a declarative sentence or statement*. It also marks the end of abbreviations.

The image humorously depicts three characters, each representing a punctuation mark: a period (.), an exclamation mark (!), and a question mark (?). The caption reads: "There's a guy who knows how to kill a conversation."

The joke plays on how punctuation affects communication. The period (.) symbolizes the end of a sentence—and in conversation, it can signal abrupt closure, making interactions feel final or unengaging.

In this meme, the function of comma and period are shown in the dialogue, with the comma (left) is a punctuation used for a pause in the sentence while the period (right) is used to end a sentence.

Punctuation refers to the marks or symbols used in writing to clarify meaning. In this picture, the first text says, “I love her, period.” Because there's no punctuation, it can be read in two ways: “I love her. Period” (as in, "I really love her. End of discussion.") and “I love her period” (referring to her menstrual cycle). And the response to "Your total lack of punctuation makes that DISGUSTING." This highlights the awkwardness caused by skipping a simple period.

The pun plays on the dual meaning of the word "sentence."

1. **Grammar meaning:** A sentence is a group of words that convey a complete thought, ending with a period (.); also called a "full stop."
2. **Legal meaning:** A sentence refers to the punishment or duration of time someone must serve in prison after being convicted of a crime.

The joke suggests that a prisoner’s favorite punctuation mark is a period (.) because it symbolizes the end of their prison sentence—just as a period marks the end of a written sentence.
