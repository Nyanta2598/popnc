# 🗣️ Direct and Indirect Speech

**Reported speech** (also called **Direct and Indirect Speech**) is how we report what someone else has said.

---

## 🟦 What is Direct Speech?

> We quote the **exact words** spoken by someone.

**Structure**:  
`"Sentence,"` said the speaker.

**Example**:

> 🔹 She said, "**I am tired.**"

✅ Uses quotation marks  
✅ Keeps the original tense and pronouns

---

## 🟨 What is Indirect Speech?

> We **report** what someone said **without quoting** their exact words.

**Structure**:  
Speaker + said/told + that + reported sentence

**Example**:

> 🔹 She said **that she was tired.**

❌ No quotation marks  
🔁 Tense, pronouns, and time words often change
