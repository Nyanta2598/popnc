Nouns are *words that name a person, place, thing, or idea*. They are a fundamental part of speech in English, and they can function as the subject, object, or complement within a sentence.

In following the English grammatical rules, the first letter of a proper noun must be capitalized. In this meme, Karl Marx is the proponent of the Marxist philosophy — a philosophy that believes that capitalism (an economic and political system wherein a selected few control the resources and power) is bad and exploitative.

While nouns are traditionally naming words (for people, places, things, etc.), the meme humorously hints at the deeper linguistic twist—that some nouns can also function as verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, which adds a layer of chaos to an otherwise simple grammar rule.

> 💡 This meme uses the Joker’s intense, dramatic persona to highlight the complexity of nouns.

A proper noun is the specific name of a person, place, or thing and is always capitalized, while a common noun is a general term that refers to a class or category of people, places, or things and is not capitalized unless it begins a sentence. 

For example, in the phrase “Ethel is a cat,” the word Ethel is a proper noun because it is the unique name of a particular cat. It refers to one specific individual, just like how "London" refers to a specific city or "Sarah" to a specific person. On the other hand, the word cat is a common noun because it refers to a general type of animal rather than a specific one. While there are many cats, Ethel is the name of one particular cat.

This meme uses an image of *Chuck Norris*, known for his action-movie roles, to make a humorous point about grammar.

The top text says, “CAPITALIZE A COMMON NOUN,” while the bottom text says, “AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.” The implication is that capitalizing a common noun (a noun that isn’t a proper noun like a person’s name or a place name), which is grammatically incorrect, will have unexpected and potentially negative consequences, much like Chuck Norris’s actions in his films. 

> 💡 The meme plays on the idea of Chuck Norris’s tough-guy persona to exaggerate the supposed severity of the grammatical error.  It’s a lighthearted way to remind people about the importance of proper grammar.

It is not often that Filipino words get recognized by the Oxford English Dictionary, but gigil was officially recognized as a loan word in the English language, which can both be a noun or an adjective depending on its usage.

This cartoon humorously depicts a teacher advising a student to avoid "verbing" nouns—turning nouns into verbs (like Google into googling). The joke lies in the irony that even the phrase “a big ask” is itself a noun being used creatively.

This image is a humorous scene from the TV show House M.D., where a character tells Dr. House, "I've heard your name." Dr. House wittily replies, "Most people have. It's also a noun," playing on the double meaning of "house" as both his surname and a common noun referring to a building. The joke hinges on clever wordplay and House's famously sarcastic demeanor.

The image above is a meme showing two panels that contrast the use of the word “skin” as a noun and as a verb.

* **Skin as a noun** refers to the thin layer of tissues that act as natural covering of a body. It sometimes refers to the appearance or outfit of a character or an item (likely from a video game like Minecraft, League of Legends, Valorant, or similar).
* **Skin as a verb** refers to a literal act of removing someone’s skin.

In Sabrina Carpenter’s song, “Cindy Lou Who,” the phrase “Cindy Lou Who” itself acts as a proper noun.  It functions as the name of a person, although the lyrics leave it ambiguous whether she is a real individual or a personification of the singer’s emotional state.
