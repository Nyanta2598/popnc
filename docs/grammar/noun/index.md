# 🏃🏿‍♂️ Noun

Nouns are *words that name a person, place, thing, or idea*. They are a fundamental part of speech in English, and they can function as the subject, object, or complement within a sentence. Nouns can be categorized into various types, including common nouns, proper nouns, concrete nouns, abstract nouns, and collective nouns.

> In following the English grammatical rules, the first letter of a proper noun must be capitalized. In this meme, Karl Marx is the proponent of the Marxist philosophy — a philosophy that believes that capitalism (an economic and political system wherein a selected few control the resources and power) is bad and exploitative.

> This meme uses the Joker’s intense, dramatic persona to highlight the complexity of nouns. While nouns are traditionally naming words (for people, places, things, etc.), the meme humorously hints at the deeper linguistic twist—that some nouns can also function as verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, which adds a layer of chaos to an otherwise simple grammar rule.

> A proper noun is the specific name of a person, place, or thing and is always capitalized, while a common noun is a general term that refers to a class or category of people, places, or things and is not capitalized unless it begins a sentence. 
>
> For example, in the phrase “Ethel is a cat,” the word Ethel is a proper noun because it is the unique name of a particular cat. It refers to one specific individual, just like how "London" refers to a specific city or "Sarah" to a specific person. On the other hand, the word cat is a common noun because it refers to a general type of animal rather than a specific one. While there are many cats, Ethel is the name of one particular cat.

> This meme uses an image of Chuck Norris, known for his action-movie roles, to make a humorous point about grammar.
>
> The top text says, “CAPITALIZE A COMMON NOUN,” while the bottom text says, “AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.”  The implication is that capitalizing a common noun (a noun that isn’t a proper noun like a person’s name or a place name), which is grammatically incorrect, will have unexpected and potentially negative consequences, much like Chuck Norris’s actions in his films.  The meme plays on the idea of Chuck Norris’s tough-guy persona to exaggerate the supposed severity of the grammatical error.  It’s a lighthearted way to remind people about the importance of proper grammar.
